Welcome to Job's baseTemplate to get started with JavaFX and connecting to API's

Please note that basic initialization is done in "res/conf/###.properties"
Here you can initialize the Api you'll connect to and initialize your basic app info

By extending the Controller class in your controllers you can easaly switch between scenes using the nextScene() method
Note that this fuction requires a path relative to the current controller.

Please note that if you want to use the json-simple you'll need to ad this jar file as library

To install this repository you'll need to put the following commant in the terminal:
<p style="background-color:#000; color: #ffffff; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">$ git clone https://github.com/job008/JavaFX-APIConnect {dirName}</p>

I hope this will help
Have Fun!
