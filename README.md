Welcome to Job's baseTemplate to get started with JavaFX and connecting to API's

Please note that basic initialization is done in "res/conf/###.properties"
Here you can initialize the Api you'll connect to and initialize your basic app info

By extending the Controller class in your controllers you can easaly switch between scenes using the nextScene() method
Note that this fuction requires a path relative to the current controller.

I hope this will help
Have Fun!
